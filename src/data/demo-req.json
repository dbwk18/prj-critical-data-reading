    "So far this time, in contrast with 15 years ago, the broader stockmarket has been relatively unruffled by the turmoil within banking. The VIX “fear” index measures the volatility of the S&P 500, America’s leading share index, which rises as investors become jittery. A value above 30 is seen as bad news. The index peaked at 80 in September 2008 after Lehman Brothers, an investment bank, collapsed. Today the VIX is at a relatively benign 22, which suggests that investors are so far keeping calm (see right-hand chart). The S&P 500 is up by 3% over the past week."
